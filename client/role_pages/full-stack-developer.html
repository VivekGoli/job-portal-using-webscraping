      <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
      <p>A full-stack developer is a software engineer who can work on both the front-end and back-end of a web application. They have a broad understanding of both client-side and server-side technologies, and they can work independently to develop and maintain entire web applications.</p>
      <p>Responsibilities of a full-stack developer:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Front-end development:</strong> Full-stack developers are responsible for the user interface (UI) of a web application.</li>
            <li><strong>Back-end development:</strong> Full-stack developers are also responsible for the server-side code of a web application. This includes writing the code that handles user requests, processes data, and interacts with databases.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Full-stack developers should be able to test their own code, as well as code written by other developers.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Full-stack developers should be able to deploy web applications to production environments.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The increasing demand for web applications is also driving the demand for full-stack developers. As businesses move their operations online and rely on web applications to reach their customers and partners, the need for skilled full-stack developers to develop and maintain these applications will continue to grow.</p>
